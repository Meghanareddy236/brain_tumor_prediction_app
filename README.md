BRAIN TUMOR PREDICTION PROJECT ...

**Leveraging machine learning to predict the likelihood of stroke based on user inputs.**

This project: developed using Flask and advanced machine learning algorithms! This system leverages key health metrics like age, glucose levels, BMI, hypertension, and lifestyle factors to predict the likelihood of a stroke with high precision and reliability.

âœ¨ Project Highlights:

ðŸ”¹ Achieved an impressive fold accuracy of 97.9%, reflecting the model's reliability.

ðŸ”¹ Addressed class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE. It improves model performance by making sure the model has enough data from the underrepresented class.
